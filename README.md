# PythonVRFT
VRFT Adaptive Control Library


Aim of this library is to provide an implementation of the VRFT (Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning) algorithm.


Objectives

- Implement the basic VRFT algorithm (1 DOF. offline, linear controller, controller expressed as scalar product theta*f(z))
- Implement  multiple DOF, sensitivity analysis
- Implement online version
- Generalize to other kind of controllers
- Advanced work (non linear systems ?)
